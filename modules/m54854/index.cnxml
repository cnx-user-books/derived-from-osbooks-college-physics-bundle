	<para id="fs-id1468182">Continuing to use ideas that would be familiar to the ancient Greeks, we look for smaller and smaller structures in nature, hoping ultimately to find and understand the most fundamental building blocks. Atomic physics deals with the smallest units of elements and compounds. Through the study of atomic physics, we have found a relatively small number of atoms with systematic properties that explain a tremendous range of phenomena.</para>
	<para id="fs-id2601714">Nuclear physics is concerned with the nuclei of atoms and their substructures, supporting Big Idea 1, that systems have internal structure. Furthermore, the internal structure of a system determines many properties of the system (Enduring Understanding 1.A). Here, a smaller number of components—the proton and neutron—make up all nuclei. Neutrons and protons are composed of quarks. Electrons, neutrinos, photons, and quarks are examples of fundamental particles. The positive electric charge on protons and neutral charge on neutrons result from their quark compositions (Essential Knowledge 1.A.2).</para><para id="fs-id3186509">This chapter divides elementary particles into fundamental particles as objects that do not have internal structure and composed particles whose properties are defined by their substructures (Essential Knowledge 1.A.2). The magnetic dipole moment, related to the properties of spin (angular momentum) and charge, is an intrinsic property of some fundamental particles such as the electron (Essential Knowledge 1.E.6). This property is the fundamental source of magnetic behavior in matter (Enduring Understanding 1.E).</para><para id="fs-id2790878">Exploring the systematic behavior of interactions among particles has revealed even more about matter, forces, and energy. Mass and electric charge are properties of matter that are conserved (Enduring Understanding 1.C). The total energy of the system is also conserved (Enduring Understanding 5.B). In quantum mechanical systems, mass is actually part of the internal energy of an object or system (Essential Knowledge 5.B.11). It has been discovered experimentally that, due to certain interactions between systems, mass can be converted to energy and energy can be converted to mass (Essential Knowledge 1.C.4, Essential Knowledge 4.C.4), supporting Big Idea 4. These process can also lead to changes in the total energy of the system (Enduring Understanding 4.C).</para><para id="fs-id2508446">Particle physics deals with the substructures of atoms and nuclei and is particularly aimed at finding those truly fundamental particles that have no further substructure. In general, any system can be viewed as a collection of objects, where objects do not have internal structure (Essential Knowledge 1.A.1). Just as in atomic and nuclear physics, we have found a complex array of particles and properties with systematic characteristics analogous to the periodic table and the chart of nuclides. We have discovered that changes in the systems are constrained by the conservation laws, supporting Big Idea 5. In the case of elementary particles, these conservation laws include mass-energy conservation and conservation of electric charge (Enduring Understanding 5.C). Electric charge is conserved in elementary particle reactions, even when elementary particles are produced or destroyed (Essential Knowledge 5.C.1).</para><para id="fs-id2641390">The chapter revisits the ideas of fundamental forces (Enduring Understanding 3.G) and their fields in connection to elementary particles. This supports Big Ideas 2 and 3, because these particles are carriers of a specific force that provides existence of the field in space (Enduring Understanding 2.A). The field is simply the macroscopic outcome of all these force-carrying particles. The approximate relative strength and range of the gravitational force (Essential Knowledge 3.G.1), electromagnetic force (Essential Knowledge 3.G.2), strong force (Essential Knowledge 3.G.3) and weak force are considered in relation to the properties of their carrier particles. The details of these considerations go beyond AP® expectations.</para><para id="fs-id2309472">An underlying structure is apparent, and there is some reason to think that we <emphasis effect="italics">are</emphasis> finding particles that have no substructure. Of course, we have been in similar situations before. For example, atoms were once thought to be the ultimate substructure. Perhaps we will find deeper and deeper structures and never come to an ultimate substructure. We may never really know, as indicated in <link target-id="import-auto-id1169738082652"/>.</para>

        <caption>The properties of matter are based on substructures called molecules and atoms. Molecules are formed from atoms. Atoms have the substructure of a nucleus with orbiting electrons, the interactions of which explain atomic properties. Protons and neutrons, the interactions of which explain the stability and abundance of elements, form the substructure of nuclei. Protons and neutrons are not fundamental—they are composed of quarks. Like electrons and a few other particles, quarks may be fundamental building blocks, lacking any further substructure. But the story is not complete, because quarks and electrons may have substructure smaller than is presently observable.</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1537228">This chapter covers the basics of particle physics as we know it today. An amazing convergence of topics is evolving in modern particle physics. We find that some particles are intimately related to forces, and that nature on the smallest scale may have a defining influence on the large-scale character of the universe. The study of particle physics is an adventure beyond even the best science fiction, because it is not only fantastic, it is real. </para>
