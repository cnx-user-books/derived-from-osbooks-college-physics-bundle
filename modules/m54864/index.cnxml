    <para id="import-auto-id1169737814519">As first discussed in <link document="m54861">Problem-Solving Strategies</link> and mentioned at various points in the text since then, there are only four distinct basic forces in all of nature. This is a remarkably small number considering the myriad phenomena they explain. Particle physics is intimately tied to these four forces. Certain fundamental particles, called carrier particles, carry these forces, and all particles can be classified according to which of the four forces they feel. The table given below summarizes important characteristics of the four basic forces.</para><table id="import-auto-id1169738010507" summary="Properties of the Four Basic Forces"><title>Properties of the Four Basic Forces</title>

Time is graphed vertically while the distance is graphed horizontally. The two positive charges are seen to be repelled by the photon exchange.</caption></figure><para id="import-auto-id1169737711569">Although these four forces are distinct and differ greatly from one another under all but the most extreme circumstances, we can see similarities among them. (In <link document="m54874">GUTs: the Unification of Forces</link>, we will discuss how the four forces may be different manifestations of a single unified force.) Perhaps the most important characteristic among the forces is that they are all transmitted by the exchange of a carrier particle, exactly like what Yukawa had in mind for the strong nuclear force. Each carrier particle is a virtual particle—it cannot be directly observed while transmitting the force. <link target-id="import-auto-id1169737794163"/> shows the exchange of a virtual photon between two positive charges.

This graph of time versus position is called a <term id="import-auto-id1169738012710">Feynman diagram</term>, after the brilliant American physicist Richard Feynman (1918–1988) who developed it.</para><para id="eip-310"><link target-id="import-auto-id1169737991710"/> is a Feynman diagram for the exchange of a virtual pion between a proton and a neutron representing the same interaction as in <link document="m54855" target-id="import-auto-id1169737824808"/>. Feynman diagrams are not only a useful tool for visualizing interactions at the quantum mechanical level, they are also used to calculate details of interactions, such as their strengths and probability of occurring. Feynman was one of the theorists who developed the field of <term id="import-auto-id1169738105552">quantum electrodynamics</term> (QED), which is the quantum mechanics of electromagnetism. QED has been spectacularly successful in describing electromagnetic interactions on the submicroscopic scale. Feynman was an inspiring teacher, had a colorful personality, and made a profound impact on generations of physicists. He shared the 1965 Nobel Prize with Julian Schwinger and S. I. Tomonaga for work in QED with its deep implications for particle physics.</para><para id="import-auto-id1169738114234">Why is it that particles called gluons are listed as the carrier particles for the strong nuclear force when, in <link document="m54855">The Yukawa Particle and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle Revisited</link>, we saw that pions apparently carry that force? The answer is that pions are exchanged but they have a substructure and, as we explore it, we find that the strong force is actually related to the indirectly observed but more fundamental <term id="import-auto-id1169738037481">gluons</term>. In fact, all the carrier particles are thought to be fundamental in the sense that they have no substructure. Another similarity among carrier particles is that they are all bosons (first mentioned in <link document="m54994">Patterns in Spectra Reveal More Quantization</link>), having integral intrinsic spins.</para><para id="import-auto-id1169738219953">There is a relationship between the mass of the carrier particle and the range of the force. The photon is massless and has energy. So, the existence of (virtual) photons is possible only by virtue of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle and can travel an unlimited distance. Thus, the range of the electromagnetic force is infinite. This is also true for gravity. It is infinite in range because its carrier particle, the graviton, has zero rest mass. (Gravity is the most difficult of the four forces to understand on a quantum scale because it affects the space and time in which the others act. But gravity is so weak that its effects are extremely difficult to observe quantum mechanically. We shall explore it further in <link document="m54833">General Relativity and Quantum Gravity</link>).

This is what keeps us from falling into the planet, and also allows us to push on other objects and generally interact with them.</para>

However, within the nucleus, the electrostatic repulsion of the protons would break the nucleus apart if it were not for the strong force, which holds the nucleus together. At even smaller scales, within nucleons such as protons and neutrons, the weak force is responsible for nuclear decays.</para>
