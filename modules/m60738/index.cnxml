<para id="fs-id1169086018704">Is time the same for everyone?  Do movement and speed influence time?  In 1905, Einstein publiished his paper on special relativity, which addressed these issues and many more.  His theory was straightforward, but its implications were significant and counterintuitive.  Einstein demonstrated that events that are simultaneous for one observer may not be simultaneous for another observer. Likewise, an object is measured to be shorter in the direction it is moving.  Special relativity revealed these and other outcomes, often with regard to observation. Special relativity also introduces one of the most famous equations in science: E=mc<sup>2</sup>.</para><para id="fs-id1169085869109">In this chapter, you will learn more about Einstein’s theory of special relativity and the experiments and problems that led to this theory. By the end of the chapter, you’ll be able to describe the consequences of relativity, including time dilation, length contraction, and the conservation of relativistic momentum. You will also be able to perform calculations involving mass-energy transformation using Einstein’s famous equation: E=mc<sup>2</sup>.</para>
