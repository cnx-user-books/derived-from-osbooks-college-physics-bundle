<para id="fs-id1169086063408">Have you ever considered buying an electric car, such as those described in the <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02elecarmobile">video</link>? Electric cars aren’t new, as the first was actually invented in the early 1800s. However, the high performance and great energy efficiency of modern electric cars is a testament to humanity’s evolving knowledge of electrical circuits.</para>
<para id="fs-id1169085742518">An electrical circuit is basically a path that allows charged particles to flow through it. In most electrical devices, these charged particles are electrons. The negatively-charged electrons flow from a voltage source (generator or battery) through a wire made of conducting materials, like copper. The circuit then returns to the source, as all circuits must be complete loops, or closed, in order to move electrons. In this chapter, you will determine the characteristics of circuits using Ohm’s Law and learn about different types of electrical circuits and electric power. You will also learn about the relationship between electric current and magnetism. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to relate current to charge and time, distinguish between types of current, describe Ohm’s Law and the meaning of resistance, interpret circuit diagrams, calculate equivalent resistance and describe modern forms of electric power.</para>
