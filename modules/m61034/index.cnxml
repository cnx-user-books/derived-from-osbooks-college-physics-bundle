<para id="fs-id1169086114274">We will now conclude our study of physics with a look at the current frontiers of physics. A frontier is a place that is unknown but holds promise of adventure and new discoveries. Each new discovery leads to new questions, and this chapter is about those questions as they relate to physics. This <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02futurephys">video</link> will be a good starting point for a discussion of future discoveries in physics. We will then ascend into the universe and contemplate its future and the possibility of its end in this <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02universe">video</link>. Finally, we will descend deep inside the atom in this <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02stringtheory">video</link> and learn about the attempts to unite relativity and quantum theory into a grand unified theory with the power to explain everything in the universe!</para>
<para id="fs-id1169082718117">In this chapter, you will learn about our attempts to unify the four forces in nature, and our discoveries about the origin and future of our universe. You will also learn about phenomena such as black holes and dark matter, and you will have a peek into the future frontiers of physics. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to calculate the size of a black hole, describe string theory and how it relates to the fabric of the universe, and predict the future of our universe, using evidence we have today.</para>
