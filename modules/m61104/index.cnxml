<para id="fs-id1169084640689">Do you have momentum? In everyday use, "gaining momentum" often refers to picking up speed or productivity while working toward a goal. However, even if you are sitting on the couch doing nothing, you still have momentum, in the physical sense.</para>
<para id="fs-id1169084917381">In physics, momentum describes the ability of a moving object to continue moving in the same direction. Indeed, even when you are sitting on your couch, you have momentum because of the motion of the Earth, which continues in its orbit around the sun at a constant speed. We also recognize that momentum relates to collisions, which can change momentum or even reduce it to zero. As expected, it is harder to stop or deflect larger or faster moving objects than smaller and slower moving objects. Therefore, an object’s momentum grows as the object’s mass and/or velocity increase, as with the football players in the <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02collisions">video</link>. In this chapter, you will learn about momentum, collisions, and how to use momentum equations to solve collision problems. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to describe momentum, the law of conservation of momentum, impulse and the impulse-momentum theorem. You will also be able to apply Newton’s second law to explain momentum.</para>
