<para id="fs-id1169084641611">Perhaps you have heard about the search for the “God particle”, more properly referred to as the Higgs boson. Physicists working at the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator—the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN (which translates to the European Organization for Nuclear Research), have been smashing together subatomic particles to search for the elusive Higgs boson. Why? The <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02partphysics">video</link> explains how experiments in particle physics can further our understanding of the quantum world and eventually link quantum and classical physics in a grand unified theory.</para>
<para id="fs-id1169084925810">In this chapter, you will learn about the particles observed and predicted by the Standard Model. You will also discover the role of carrier particles in the four fundamental forces. Finally, your study of physics will culminate with the search for a grand unified theory. By the end of the chapter, you’ll be able to describe each of the particles in the Standard Model and explain the role of these microscopic particles in the macroscopic world. You will then be able to explain the importance of grand unified theories and how they can be tested.</para>
