<para id="fs-id1169085746804">What do you think of when you hear the words “nuclear” or “radioactive”? It is easy to have a negative opinion of nuclear physics due to nuclear weapons, harmful nuclear radiation and meltdowns at nuclear power plants. However, the discovery of the nucleus and the understanding of its possible uses have changed our lives. Indeed, many explorations, including the voyages to the moon, relied on nuclear-powered vessels. In the present, countries like the USA and France depend on nuclear energy as one of the main sources of electricity. The <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02reactorcore">video</link> demonstrates the operation of a nuclear reactor and how it is used in the power production cycle. Along with nuclear power, nuclear physics has many other positive uses, such as radioactive medicine and radioactive dating. In this chapter, you will learn about the discovery of radioactivity and how it led to the development of nuclear physics. You will learn about the devices used to detect radiation, and the new concept of quantum tunneling which allows a better understanding of the basic structure of matter. By the end of this chapter, you will know how to calculate the energy released in a nuclear reaction, and the binding energy that holds a nucleus together. You will also balance nuclear equations and determine the half-life of various radioactive isotopes.</para>
