<para id="fs-id1169085990574">In our daily lives, we often encounter fluids in motion: we turn on the faucet and water comes out; on a winter day, we watch smoke rise from a chimney.  We use the power of water to produce electricity in hydroelectric dams.  When constructing and managing them, engineers must consider the speed, volume, and power of the water flowing through the intakes and against the turbines. </para><para id="fs-id1169085970787">In this chapter, you will learn about the behavior of fluids in motion, including rate of flow of a fluid, laminar and turbulent flow, the Bernoulli Effect and its applications, viscosity, and other topics in fluid dynamics. By the end of this chapter, you will learn how to calculate the rate of flow of a fluid, the velocity and pressure of air in Bernoulli Effect problems, the motion of an object in a viscous fluid, and Reynolds numbers that describe the onset of turbulence.</para>
