<para id="fs-id1169085865100">Have you ever noticed how CDs and DVDs create rainbow effects when you hold them up to the light? The <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02interfcd">video</link> explains how this pattern is produced by constructive and destructive interference of light waves. These discs have microscopic grooves that contain their encoded information. If you shine a laser light through these grooves, you will notice an interesting pattern similar to those discovered by Thomas Young in the early 1800s when he performed his famous single- and double-slit experiments. The results of these experiments allowed scientists to comprehend the wave nature of light. In this chapter, you will learn about Young’s experiments and their implications for scientists who were investigating and debating the nature of light. You will also learn about other effects resulting from the wave nature of light, including diffraction, interference, and coherence, and their applications to technology. By the end of the chapter, you’ll be able to describe the wave nature of light, explain its implications, and perform calculations related to diffraction, interference, resolution, and other wave properties.</para>
