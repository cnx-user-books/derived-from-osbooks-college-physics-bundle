<para id="fs-id1169082520472">Emergency responders and medical professionals have saved countless lives with defibrillators.  Now, governments and other organizations are giving regular, untrained people the same opportunities.  Automated external defibrillators (AEDs) are becoming more common in offices, institutions, and public spaces.  The devices rely on complex technology, but are easy to use.  And like all defibrillators, they rely on capacitors.
</para><para id="eip-321">Capacitors store electric charges.  They have many applications, including communications, power transmission, signal processing, and uses in motors and other household equipment like air conditioners.  In defibrillators, the capacitor builds up the proper amount of charge to restart the or restore normal heart rhythms.  A human or computer controller then uses the stored charge to provide a dose of electricity to the heart tissue. In this chapter, you will learn about the concepts of electric potential and electric potential energy, as well as the different kinds of electric fields that surround a single charged object. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to calculate electric field strength and electric potential, calculate capacitance in series and parallel, and determine the energy stored in a capacitor, like those in a cell phone or camera flash.</para></content>
