<para id="fs-id1169086157333">Do you wear glasses or other vision correction devices? Look around you and youâ€™ll probably notice quite a few other students wearing glasses. We have used our understanding of geometric optics to create devices such as eyeglasses and contact lenses to help correct our vision problems. In addition, geometric optics has allowed us to use microscopes and telescopes to extend our vision, as demonstrated in the <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02telescope">video</link>. In this chapter, you will learn about the operation of your eye, and how your vision can be corrected. You will understand how microscopes and telescopes work, and you will become aware of aberrations in optical devices. By the end of this chapter, you will know how to calculate refractive indices, describe how an image is formed in a compound microscope, and describe the working of a telescope.</para>
