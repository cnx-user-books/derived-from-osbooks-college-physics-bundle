<para id="fs-id1169085973043">Why is the sky blue, especially when sunlight appears white, yellow or orange? Air is transparent and has no color. So what are we really seeing when we look at the blue sky? The <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02blusky">video</link> explains that the sky itself isnâ€™t producing blue color. The color relates to our ability to see different colors when we see different wavelengths of light. Pure, unfiltered sunlight contains all wavelengths of visible light. When all of these wavelengths reach our eyes at once, we see white light. However, because wavelengths of blue light bounce around the atmosphere more than other wavelengths (blue light is scattered more than other colors), the sky appears blue.</para>
<para id="fs-id1169085835724">In this chapter, you will learn more about the properties of light and how they influence vision. You will also learn about the rest of the electromagnetic spectrum, of which visible light is just a narrow subsection. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to identify electromagnetic waves by their properties, including wavelength and frequency. You will also be able to solve problems involving light and other electromagnetic waves.</para>
