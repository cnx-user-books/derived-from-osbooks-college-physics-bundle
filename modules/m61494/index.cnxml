<para id="fs-id1169085699844">Can you imagine a world without electricity? Take a look around you and you will see that electrical circuits are everywhere – from flashlights to computers, and from cars to medical devices. The logic of circuitry allows us to control systems and achieve desired results, whether it is light from a single bulb to the control of millions of microcircuits for data processing. The nervous system of the human body is, itself, a mass of circuits, as shown in the <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02circuitbod">video</link>. A simple lie-detector measures how the electrical resistivity of the body changes when a lie is told. Since nervousness promotes perspiration, the body’s electrical resistance is lowered and the current flow is increased. In this chapter, you will learn about the different types of electric circuits, the devices that measure voltage and current, and about other types of circuits such as RC circuits. By the end of this chapter, you will know how to “solve a circuit”, and determine the power it uses. You will understand the relationship between the rules of circuits as defined by the law of conservation of charge and the law of conservation of energy. You will also describe what happens to voltage across a capacitor over time as it charges.</para>
