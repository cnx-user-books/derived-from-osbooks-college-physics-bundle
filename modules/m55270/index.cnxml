<para id="fs-id979634">In this chapter, students are introduced to oscillation, the regular variation in the position of a system about a central point accompanied by transfer of energy and momentum, and to <emphasis effect="bold">waves</emphasis>. A child’s swing, a pendulum, a spring, and a vibrating string are all examples of oscillations. This chapter will address simple harmonic motion and periods of vibration, aspects of oscillation that produce waves, a common phenomenon in everyday life. Waves carry energy from one place to another.” This chapter will show how harmonic oscillations produce waves that transport energy across space and through time. The information and examples presented support Big Ideas 1, 2, and 3 of the AP® Physics Curriculum Framework.</para><para id="fs-id1424089">The chapter opens by discussing the forces that govern oscillations and waves. It goes on to discuss important concepts such as <emphasis effect="bold">simple harmonic motion</emphasis>, uniform harmonic motion, and damped harmonic motion. You will also learn about energy in simple harmonic motion and how it changes from kinetic to potential, and how the total sum, which would be the mechanical energy of the oscillator, remains constant or conserved at all times. The chapter also discusses characteristics of waves, such as their frequency, period of oscillation, and the forms in which they can exist, i.e., transverse or longitudinal. The chapter ends by discussing what happens when two or more waves overlap and how the <emphasis effect="bold">amplitude</emphasis> of the resultant wave changes, leading to the phenomena of <emphasis effect="bold">superposition</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="bold">interference</emphasis>.</para>
