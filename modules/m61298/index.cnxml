<para id="fs-id1166316419292">Why do we like music? What makes one sound different from another? Many people may mention things like treble, bass, beat, or volume when describing music. These and other characteristics of music go to the heart of the physical laws governing sound. This <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02wavesnsound">video</link> describes how sounds are created with string instruments, such as a cello. A cellist controls the sound produced by their cellos by altering string length and tension. How does this create different notes when the cello is played and how do these sounds reach our ears? Indeed, understanding the physical principles of sound enables instrument manufacturers to create the perfect instrument and instrument players to create great music.</para>
<para id="fs-id1166316296782">This chapter describes what properties of sound we can detect with our ears. By the end of the chapter, you will gain an understanding of how human ears detect sound waves and transmit them into nervous system signals that the brain can interpret. Finally, you will learn the physical basis for sound phenomena that we commonly experience, such as resonance, sonic booms and the Doppler effect.</para>
