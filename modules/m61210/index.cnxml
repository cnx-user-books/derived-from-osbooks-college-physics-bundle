<para id="fs-id1169083525509">When you think of heat, you might conjure images of the beach or the desert. What is heat? How is it defined? Heat is one of the most intriguing forms of energy, because it only exists when in transit. What we commonly refer to as “heat” is more correctly described as thermal energy. So, what you think of as heat is really thermal energy. And what can we say about cold? This is discussed in the <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02nocold">video</link>, which will educate you clearly on the terminology. Heat transfer affects us every day and, on a larger scale, helps us understand how the universe functions, and how it may end. Heat is delivered by several methods. In this chapter, you will gain knowledge of the heat capacity of substances, the different phases in which a substance can exist, and the methods of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to define specific heat, latent heat, conduction, convection, and radiation, and perform calculations involving these concepts.</para>
