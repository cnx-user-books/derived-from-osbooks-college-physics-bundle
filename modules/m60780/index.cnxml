<para id="fs-id1169085810920">Part of the fun of fireworks is the many different colors they produce! Long ago, people discovered that different chemicals produce different-colored flames when burned. But most people -- including physicists, couldn't perfectly explain why.  Why do different chemicals in fireworks -- or different stars, for that matter -- emit different colors?  The answer revolutionized physics.</para><para id="eip-912">At the end of the 19th Century, scientists were having difficulty explaining some elements of blackbody radiation, an important type of radiation that includes stars like the Sun.  </para><para id="eip-565">The <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02quantummech">video</link> explains how physicist Max Planck used these observations to discover discovered that atoms can only occupy certain energy states. In other words, their energy is quantized. This discovery marked the beginning of our evolving understanding of quantum mechanics. In this chapter, you will learn about the quantum energy states of matter and how Einstein demonstrated the particle nature of light through the photoelectric effect. You will also be introduced to the wave nature of matter and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. By the end of this chapter, youâ€™ll be able to explain the particle-wave duality of light as well as perform calculations related to the quantum energy of light, the energy of a photoelectron, and the momentum of a photon.</para></content>
