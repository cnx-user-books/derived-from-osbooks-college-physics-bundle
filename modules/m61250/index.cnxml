<para id="fs-id1169082425057">What feels colder in the room you are in right now – a wooden surface (such as that on a desk or table) or an unheated metal surface (such as a stapler or metal file cabinet)? If the entire room is heated to the same temperature, why does one object feel colder than the other? Do the feelings of hot and cold really equate to the temperatures of objects? The <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02feeltemper">video</link> shows that our sensation of warm and cold doesn’t actually indicate the temperature of objects. Instead, our temperature receptors measure the transfer of heat between our skin and the things we touch. Put more simply, we detect whether or not an object will warm or cool our body, not its actual temperature.</para>
<para id="fs-id1169085809208">In this chapter, you will learn how heat can change the pressure, volume, and temperature of materials, and how these changes can be used to do work. You will also learn how thermodynamics relates to the order of a system and how that order tends to break down over time in accordance with the laws of thermodynamics. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to apply the laws of thermodynamics to explain the behavior of gases. You will also be able to calculate the work and energy of familiar mechanical systems that utilize heat transfer, such as refrigerators and heat engines.</para>
