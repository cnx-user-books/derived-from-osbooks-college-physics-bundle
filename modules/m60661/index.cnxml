</figure><para id="fs-id1169084887680">A baseball pitcher throws a fastball that travels straight over home plate. The batter misses and the ball continues on until it hits the catcher’s mitt. On the next pitch, the batter connects with the ball, changing the ball’s direction and sending it sailing into the outfield. The <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02lawsofmotion">video</link> explains how the motion of a baseball can be described using Isaac Newton’s laws of motion, which he deduced three and a half centuries ago!</para>
<para id="fs-id1169081403174">The study of motion is kinematics, but kinematics only describes an object’s velocity and acceleration. Dynamics considers the forces that affect the motion of moving objects and systems. Newton’s laws of motion are the foundation of dynamics. According to Newton’s laws, when the bat applies a strong enough force to the ball, the ball accelerates in the direction of the bat’s force. The ball will continue to travel in a straight line unless acted on by another force, like gravity or an outfielder’s mitt. In this chapter, you will learn how Newton’s laws can be used to analyze the mathematical relationships among force, mass, acceleration, velocity, and position. By the end of the chapter, you’ll be able to use Newton’s three laws to describe and predict the motion of many familiar objects.</para>
