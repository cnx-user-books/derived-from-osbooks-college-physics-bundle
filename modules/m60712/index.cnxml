<para id="fs-id1169082398322">Imagine if every surface on Earth was like ice or Teflon, in that it had little or no friction. Would we be able to walk or drive like we do now? How would organisms adapt to such a world? You have learned about Newton’s three Laws of Motion, which form the basis of what we call “classical mechanics.” You learned that a net force affects the motion of an object, but what kinds of force can produce a net force? Friction, drag, and deformation are three such forces. This <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02worldfriction">video</link> and this <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02dragswimmer">video</link> will give you insight into these forces. In this chapter, you will learn about the unbalanced forces known as friction, drag, and deformation. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to apply this knowledge to solve more advanced problems involving Newton’s Laws.</para>
