<para id="fs-id1169085956289">Have you ever seen videos of a tornado? Why do tornadoes spin at all? And why do they spin so rapidly? This answer involves the physics behind rotational motion. The air masses that produce tornadoes are themselves rotating, and when the size of an air mass decreases (specifically, its radius), the rate of rotation of the air mass increases. An ice skater increases her spin in the same way, as shown in the <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02spinskates">video</link>. The skater starts her rotation with outstretched limbs and increases her spin by pulling her arms in towards her body. In this chapter, you will learn how energy, momentum, and their associated laws govern rotational motion. You will also learn how many aspects of linear motion that you have already learned also apply to rotational motion. By the end of this chapter, youâ€™ll be able to describe and calculate aspects of kinematics and rotational motion, including torque, angular momentum, energy, and power. You will then be able to apply these skills to solving real-world problems involving rotation.</para>
