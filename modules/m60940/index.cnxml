<para id="fs-id1169085900398">What constructive uses do we have for radioactivity? Well, have you ever had an X-ray? Radioactivity has been used in medicine since the discovery of X-rays in the late 19th century. The branch of medicine dealing with radioactivity, called radiology, has allowed scientists to create computerized images to better understand the inner workings of the human body. In the present, we also use radioactivity to detect tumors, treat cancer, and for other medical uses, as shown in the <link url="https://openstaxcollege.org/l/02radmedicine">video</link>. In this chapter, you will learn about the potential of nuclear energy to both alleviate suffering but also cause huge amounts of destruction. You will gain an understanding of why nuclear physics is often viewed with ambivalence. You will learn the difference between nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. You will learn how bacteria can be efficiently eliminated in food using irradiation techniques. By the end of this chapter, you will know how to balance nuclear equations for fission and fusion, and how to calculate energy release in fission and fusion reactions. </para>
