They jump from bridges, cranes, towers, and other elevated structures, and use an elastic cord to slow and eventually stop their downward motion. The jumper's gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy and elastic potential energy. After the initial fall, the jumper oscillates via the cord and enters harmonic motion. </para><para id="eip-153">While bungee jumping can be thrilling and even terrifying, the activity is generally quite safe.  Operators confirm to rigorous safety standards, and carefully calculate the cord length and other elements of every jump.  The video illustrates the describes the physical laws and equations that come into play.</para><para id="fs-id1166315330551">Electromagnetic waves, such as light, radio waves, infrared waves, UV waves, X-rays and others, are forms of energy. Because they are not produced by vibrating matter particles, they can traverse vast distances of space.</para><para id="fs-id1166313058345">In this chapter, you will first study oscillatory motion by investigating spring and pendulum systems. You will learn several examples of oscillatory motion, including simple harmonic motion, uniform circular motion, and damped harmonic motion. You will then learn about the properties of waves, including speed, amplitude, wavelength, and frequency. Finally, you will learn what happens when two or more waves share the same space in superposition and interference. By the end of the chapter, you will be able to model wave properties, perform calculations involving springs and Hookeâ€™s Law, measure the period and frequency of oscillations, identify and describe several forms of oscillatory motion, and calculate the energy of a wave.</para>
